# CRM_website

 This is a website that allows users to create an account, log in and add contacts to their list. Users can also create user groups (manually implemented)

 The current features allow users to share their records with a group when creating it, adding other users to the group and setting the admin.

 The form for creating a group automatically assign the user creating the group as admin and as a member on creation if no fields are selected for those options, otherwise it chooses the user selection.

 Groups can be private or public, those options are taken into consideration when users try to globablly view the groups that exist.
